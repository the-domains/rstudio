[**Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design**;interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software;user experience design; andsearch engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.][0]

The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps [web engineering in the broader scope of][1][web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of][2][usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with][3][web accessibility guidelines.][4]
